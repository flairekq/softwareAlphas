## How to play
Our game supports cross-platform so users can play it on the web or their PC (Windows/Mac Intel). Navigate to version 2.3.0 of the game and click on the “PLAY” button for the web version or download the windows/mac version.

### Web version
For the web version, after clicking on the “PLAY” button, it will redirect you to the game, and the game will load. For players that are loading it for the first time, it might take a few minutes to complete loading. However, if the game takes more than 15 minutes to load, you can try refreshing the tab or click on the “PLAY” button to get a new token to the game. Players can click on the “PLAY” button again to get a new token to the game if the game ever crashes suddenly. This a limitation that we have encountered on the web version, where we suspect that there might be some issue with the gamejolt server at certain times.

### Windows version 
For the windows version, players can open the game by running the “Madhouse Before 12.exe” after extracting the zip folder.

### Mac version
For the mac version, players can open the game by running the “Madhouse Before 12.app” after extracting the zip folder.
